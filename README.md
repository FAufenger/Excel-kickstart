Assignments pertaining to Excel Kickstart project

Organize and analyze a database of 4,000 past projects (including example: project sate, goals, pledges, country and backers) in order to uncover any hidden trends



#Results:
-Conclusion:
  • More backers means more likely to reach goal
  • Plays are the most frequently endeavored campaign
  • The goal of less than 1000 has both the highest success rate and the lowest fail rate, thus is the safest to back. Also, the success percentage trend is             generally negative when increasing the goal.  

-Some limitations of this dataset:
  •	We do not know if the backers are the same for several campaigns nor how much they individually contributed. Knowing this may show trend in certain backers         having a higher success rate.
  •	The US has the largest total of campaigns in this data at nearly 75 percent, which can skew the data (3038 of 4114). Can always use more data.

-Other possible ways to further explore info:
  •	Add the percent success and fail to the chart that shows count of success and fail per category. Example: While theater has the most success, it also has a         large percentage of fail.
  •	We can compare the number of backers (successful and unsuccessful) to each category.
  •	Staff picked campaigns vs success/ fail rate.
